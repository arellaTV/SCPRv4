There seem to be a few problems with the current SCPR program schedule:

<% if @overlaps %>
OVERLAPS
---------
<%= @overlaps.each do |overlap| %>
  * <%= overlap[0].display_name %> ends at <%= overlap[0].ends_at %> but <%= overlap[1].display_name %> starts at <%= overlap[1].starts_at %>
<% end %>
<% end %>

<% if @gaps %>
GAPS
---------
<%= @gaps.each do |gap| %>
  * <%= gap[0].display_name %> ends at <%= gap[0].ends_at %> but <%= gap[1].display_name %> starts at <%= gap[1].starts_at %>
<% end %>
<% end %>
