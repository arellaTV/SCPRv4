Story List
==========

A story list is similar to a topic cluster in that it is essentially a list of stories with thumbnails.  At some point, the two concepts may be converged.  The big difference is that a generic story list isn't limited by topic, it has different style layouts(horizontal, vertical, and quad), and each story includes a teaser.
