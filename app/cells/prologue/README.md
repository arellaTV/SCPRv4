Prologue
========

A "prologue" is a heading block that appears above the main content, usually in the header section and below the masthead.  It is similar to the "epilogue", only it's intended to describe the main content rather than contain a tangental piece of information or a call to action.

Prologues are meant to be pretty general-purpose, and so there are different modifiers to change the look of a prologue:

- **o-prologue--primary** - Basic style using our primary orange colors.
- **o-prologue--secondary** - Basic style using our secondary blue colors.
- **o-prologue--tertiary** - Basic style using greens derived from the Broke project.
- **o-prologue--program** - A prologue for program pages.
- **o-prologue--vertical** - A prologue for vertical landing pages.
