Article
=======

This renders a typical article body including the headline w/category, lead asset, inline assets, and body.

The cell should always take an Article model instance.

When the headline needs to be rendered elsewhere in the page, the option :headline can be set to false, and you can use the article_headline cell wherever you need it.
