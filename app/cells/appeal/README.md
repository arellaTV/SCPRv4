Appeal
======

An appeal is an aside that appears anywhere in the middle of article or landing pages that serves a marketing purpose and provides an action the user can take.  An example would be a newsletter signup form or an ad for our mobile app.

## Use

There are a few different appeal templates available.  For example, to render the newsletter appeal:

```ruby
  cell(:appeal).call(:newsletter)
```

## Notes

The newsletter styling is unfinished.  Finish that up and then deprecate the newsletter-appeal cell.
