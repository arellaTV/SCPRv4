      <title>When the best advice comes from the worst sources</title>
      <link>http://www.marketplace.org/topics/business/when-best-advice-comes-worst-sources</link>

        <img typeof='foaf:Image' src='http://www.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-610x340/public/55772727.jpg?itok=yQ9F_bsi'><p><a href='http://download.publicradio.org/podcast/marketplace/segments/2014/04/30/marketplace_segment23_20140430_64.mp3' target='_blank'><img src='/sites/marketplace.org/files/Listen_to_audio_flip.png'/></a></p><p>Would you trust business advice from a CEO that watched his company go bankrupt? Or relationship advice from someone who was accused of murdering their spouse?</p>
<p>Zac Bissonnette, author of the book "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Good-Advice-Bad-People-Murderers/dp/1591846897" target="_blank">Good Advice from Bad People</a>", says there are plenty of people who think they can give this type of advice through speeches or books. Usually, it’s when these people are at the height of their careers. And sometimes, they speak too soon.</p>
<p>"It just struck me about a year ago, how easy it is to become an inspirational icon or a self-help expert and that kind of thing," says Bissonnette. "And how often, the people who we look to for wisdom are terrible at following their own advice."</p>
<p>While in the process of writing, Bissonnette noticed a trend in his research.</p>
<p>"Most of the CEOs that I found were cultivating personality-driven brands right at the apex of their careers, right before it all goes to hell," says Bissonnette.</p>
<p>But the desire for self-help books, guides and products in our modern society is significant. Despite the recession in 2008, America spent $11 billion on self-improvement products.</p>
<p>"In our desperate need for motivational figures, we make almost no effort to vet them," says Bissonnette.</p>

      <title>Who wants to be bigger than the U.S.? Not China!</title>
      <link>http://www.marketplace.org/topics/world/who-wants-be-bigger-us-not-china</link>
      <description><![CDATA[
        <img typeof='foaf:Image' src='http://www.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-610x340/public/487411095.jpg?itok=XAyyug4r'>A new World Bank report suggests China’s economy could surpass America’s this year (by one measure, at least). But far from taking a triumphant tone, China’s government is rejecting the numbers. Chinese leaders are wary about how their country's rise to the top could increase pressure on them to make concessions on carbon emissions, trade policy, currency and international aid.

There's another reason for China's muted response to this news: trumpeting strong growth numbers likely wouldn't be well received by the hundreds of millions of Chinese still living in poverty.

“The Chinese government usually reacts in a very quiet way,” says Yale University finance professor Zhiwu Chen. “They realize that China overall, it’s still a developing and a poor country.”

All this is not to say that Chinese officials aren’t privately excited about economic growth. Just don’t look for any champagne, or <a href="http://www.marketplace.org/topics/world/moutai-shares-tumble-china-after-goverment-restriction" target="_blank">Moutai</a> toasts on camera.

<blockquote><p><strong>Nicholas Lardy</strong>: It certainly puts pressure on them to do more in the international arena.</p></blockquote>
<p>When the numbers say you’re a bigger deal, other countries push you harder to give aid, change trade policy and stop screwing around with your currency. Dartmouth business school associate dean Matt Slaughter explains that rising in the ranks also brings attention to Chinese industrial pollution.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Matt Slaughter</strong>: The faster is China’s growth, the more the world legitimately looks to China for any meaningful carbon reduction.</p></blockquote>
<p>China also worries about how economic news plays domestically, where hundreds of millions still live in poverty. Yale finance professor Zhiwu Chen says trumpeting growth numbers wouldn’t go over well at home.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Zhiwu Chen</strong>: The Chinese government usually reacts in a very quiet way, because they realize that China overall, it’s still a developing and poor country.</p></blockquote>
<p>Remember, Lardy adds, China tops another important chart.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Lardy</strong>: All of the measures are in a sense a little bit artificial, because they’re a function to a considerable extent of the fact that China has 1.3 billion people.</p></blockquote>
<p>Spread over its giant population, the swelling GDP isn’t much per person. Now all this doesn’t mean Chinese officials aren’t excited about economic growth, says Milken Institute managing director Perry Wong.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Perry Wong</strong>: To be ranked #1, they may celebrate in private.</p></blockquote>
<p>But any champagne, or Moutai toasts won’t be done on camera. I'm Mark Garrison, for Marketplace.</p>

      <title>New York parents opt out of high stakes tests </title>
      <link>http://www.marketplace.org/topics/economy/education/new-york-parents-opt-out-high-stakes-tests</link>
      <description><![CDATA[
        <img typeof='foaf:Image' src='http://www.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-610x340/public/Standardized%20Test%20Protest.jpg?itok=WKSKMFb_'><p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857em;">Last year, Amelia Costigan watched as her twin sons and their fourth-grade classmates prepared for the new state tests. It was the first year New York’s assessments were based on the Common Core, the nationally standardized curricula that many states have adopted in recent years. And, a lot was at stake in New York. The kids literally worried themselves sick. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“My kids had trouble sleeping,” Costigan says. “Other kids had stomach aches. Kids were going to the doctors, and the doctors were saying it looked like it was stress from the test.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857em;">The tests determined whether her sons advanced to the next grade, or got into a top middle school. Scores also played into teacher evaluations and school rankings. This year, Costigan and the parents of eight other kids at her school decided they didn’t want their kids to participate. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“It was a hard decision that some of them had. They cried. They worried they weren’t going to go to graduation, but in the end, all 10 kids opted out,” she says. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Parents’ groups estimate about 1,000 kids in New York City won’t be taking the Common Core assessments this year. Statewide, it’s about 35,000. Those numbers are hard to verify and they represent just  a tiny fraction of the total number of kids sitting down for the math tests this week. </span><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857em;"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But opting out is the most drastic—and visible—part of a growing protest movement in New York and nationwide. </span><span class="s1" style="line-height: 1.42857em;">Parents, teachers, and other critics have been holding rallies, trying to put an end to the standardized tests.</span><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857em;"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857em;"><div class="media media-element-container media-primary_image"><span id="styles-0-0" class="styles file-styles embed_display">  <img typeof="foaf:Image" src="http://www.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-610x340/public/ManAndSonProtesting.jpg?itok=wbIGlDmG" width="610" height="340" alt="" title="Protesters in New York" /></span><div class="field field-name-field-byline-text field-type-text field-label-hidden multi-value-field"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item first even">Dan Bobkoff/Marketplace</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-description field-type-text-long field-label-hidden multi-value-field"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item first even"></div></div></div></div></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At a rally in Lower Manhattan last week, Liz Rosenberg says her fourth grade daughter wasn’t scared of the tests at first. </span><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857em;"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“She was super psyched to take it,” she says.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857em;">But Rosenberg was anything but psyched. Part of her objection is that questions and answers are not released after the test, so it’s hard for kids to know what they don’t know. She convinced her daughter that the tests are a bad idea. This year, she’s opting out. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“It’s important to stand up. It’s important to talk back,” Rosenberg says.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many teachers and critics believe the math is confusing and the English questions are too hard. Fourth graders are being asked to assess middle school level reading, some say. </span><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857em;"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We felt the questions did not actually assess whether children were reading with understanding, which we thought was really important to assess,” says Elizabeth Phillips, principal of PS 321 in Brooklyn. </span><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857em;"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She’s not anti-testing or against the Common Core, but she say seeing the English exams turned her off. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Phillips was also concerned that so much was riding on these tests. Like other critics, she held protests. And, to some degree they worked. </span><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857em;"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Up until a few weeks ago, there really was a lot at stake,” she says. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><div class="media media-element-container media-primary_image"><span id="styles-1-0" class="styles file-styles embed_display">  <img id="1" typeof="foaf:Image" src="http://www.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-610x340/public/ChangeStakesOccupyEdu.jpg?itok=XNZlGMSF" width="610" height="340" alt="" title="Protesters in New York" /></span><div class="field field-name-field-byline-text field-type-text field-label-hidden multi-value-field"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item first even">Dan Bobkoff/Marketplace</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-description field-type-text-long field-label-hidden multi-value-field"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item first even"></div></div></div></div></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Recently, New York officials scrambled to lower the stakes. No longer will test scores go on students’ permanent records. And, they won’t be used as the major determinant of whether kids go onto the next grade. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857em;">Officials think that change will go a long way to placate many nervous parents.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Knowing that the state test will only be used as one of multiple factors has eased some of those concerns,” says Emily Weiss, senior executive director of performance at New York City Department of Education</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At some point, if too few students take the tests, some schools could lose funds.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s still far off, but with opposition to the tests mounting, New York’s fight could be coming to a state near you. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><div class="media media-element-container media-primary_image"><span id="styles-2-0" class="styles file-styles embed_display">  <img id="2" typeof="foaf:Image" src="http://www.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-610x340/public/ShowUsTheTests.jpg?itok=MwiDE5-8" width="610" height="340" alt="" title="Protesters in New York" /></span><div class="field field-name-field-byline-text field-type-text field-label-hidden multi-value-field"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item first even">Dan Bobkoff/Marketplace</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-description field-type-text-long field-label-hidden multi-value-field"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item first even"></div></div></div></div></span></p>

      <title>If Clippers are for sale, what&#039;s the franchise worth?</title>
      <link>http://www.marketplace.org/topics/business/if-clippers-are-sale-whats-franchise-worth</link>
      <description><![CDATA[
        <img typeof='foaf:Image' src='http://www.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-610x340/public/487377023.jpg?itok=77mMlZp4'><p>As the next step in the public punishment of Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald T. Sterling, the NBA says it’s going to try to <a href="http://www.marketplace.org/topics/business/adam-silver-nba-will-try-force-clippers-sale" target="_blank">force him to sell his team</a>. But this isn’t exactly a fire sale.</p>
<p>The traditional profit-focused reasons for buying a sports franchise are well established says Michael Leeds, a sports economist at Temple University. “I mean, you can go back to the 19<sup>th</sup> century," he says. "People would buy baseball teams because they owned a tavern nearby and they wanted to sell their beer.”</p>
<p>Nowadays, Leeds notes, owners are more likely to buy shares in media networks, but he says the payoff for ownership can come in different forms.</p>
<p>“When you own a sports franchise, you join a very exclusive club," he says. "As George Steinbrenner once said, 'Before I bought the Yankees, I was just some ship builder in Tampa.'”</p>
<p>Leeds says there’s a rush that comes with seeing your name in the paper, and some buyers are willing to pay a premium for that. Celebrities from David Geffen to Oprah Winfrey are reported to be interested in buying the Clippers. And all <em>that</em> buzz can drive prices up. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/teams/los-angeles-clippers/" target="_blank">While Donald Sterling  bought the Clippers for only $12 million dollars more than 30 years ago, one currenet estimate is $575 million</a>. </p>

There are supposed to be seven governors, but right now, there are just four, with three nominees awaiting Senate confirmation. And another vacancy is looming in May.</p>
<p>“We’ve never had a situation like we’re in now,” says Peter Conti-Brown, a fellow at Stanford law school who’s writing a history of the Fed. He says it’s rare to have so many vacancies on the board of governors.</p>

      <title>Only one person has gone to jail for the financial crisis</title>
      <link>http://www.marketplace.org/topics/economy/only-one-person-has-gone-jail-financial-crisis</link>
      <description><![CDATA[
        <img typeof='foaf:Image' src='http://www.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-610x340/public/Kareem.jpg?itok=EH7PyH1l'><p>Only one banker has gone to jail for his role in the financial crisis. That person is Kareem Serageldin, formerly an executive at Credit Suisse. He began serving his 30 month sentence earlier this year.</p>
<p>“It’s not a conspiracy,” says <a href="https://twitter.com/eisingerj" target="_blank">Jesse Eisinger</a>, a senior reporter at ProPublica, on why there have been so criminal proceedings. Instead, the Department of Justice was chastened by a series of court losses, and “effectively lost its ability to indict corporations or go after individuals at the highest echelons of corporate America.”</p>
<p>Eisinger details how the Department of Justice "lost its way" <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/04/magazine/only-one-top-banker-jail-financial-crisis.html?_r=0" target="_blank">in an article</a> for the <em>New York Times Magazine</em>.</p>
<p>In his account, the turning point was the case against Enron’s Arthur Anderson. Two years after winning the original case, the Supreme Court overturned the verdict. Eisinger says the Supreme Court “didn’t say that Arthur Anderson was not guilty of the crime that they had been indicted for, which was obstruction of justice. It revolved around jury instructions. But the Department of Justice took this as a huge black eye.”</p>
<p>Ever since, the DOJ has focused on crimes that are easier to win – such as insider trading cases. And they’ve been reluctant to investigate or bring charges against company CEOs.  </p>
<p>“The real bad actors are the top officers in companies that commit crimes," Eisinger said. "And you have to go after them successfully if you want to deter white collar crime.”</p>

      <title>Drought puts California rice in a sticky situation</title>
      <link>http://www.marketplace.org/topics/sustainability/drought-puts-california-rice-sticky-situation</link>
      <description><![CDATA[
        <img typeof='foaf:Image' src='http://www.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-610x340/public/Ricephoto1.jpg?itok=HU21sWXw'><p><a href='http://download.publicradio.org/podcast/marketplace/segments/2014/04/30/marketplace_segment22_20140430_64.mp3' target='_blank'><img src='/sites/marketplace.org/files/Listen_to_audio_flip.png'/></a></p><p>That sweet sticky rice that comes with your sushi likely came from California. <span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">The state grows almost all of the nation’s medium grain rice, and about half of it is exported.</span></p>
<p>And California's drought is expected to have a dramatic effect on rice production. Economists say the mere speculation of production losses is already driving up prices.</p>
<p>Ninety-seven percent of California’s rice is grown in the Sacramento Valley, including at<span style="line-height: 1.42857em;"> Montna Farms, where a huge drag scrapers level fields in preparation for planting. Nicole Van Vleck says medium grain rice will grow here, which is perfect for sushi.  </span></p>
<p>“If you’re eating sushi rice in New York, or in Florida, or San Francisco you’re most likely undoubtedly going to be eating California rice,” says Van Vleck.</p>
<p>Van Vleck stands next to a water pump that’s flooding the field behind her.</p>
<p>“So this is water that’s coming from the Feather River. The Feather is just to the east of us, we divert out of the Feather,” she says.</p>
<p>Northern California farmers typically have plenty of water compared to those in the south, even during dry years. <span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">But not this year.</span></p>
<p>“This is the first time I know of that we cut back rice acreage because surface water allocations were cut so severely to water districts north of Sacramento,” says Dan Sumner, an agriculture economist at the University of California Davis.</p>
<p>Montna Farms has been in the Sacramento Valley for generations. But this is the first time a drought has caused so much uncertainty.</p>
<p>“It’s unlike anything I’ve ever had to deal with,” says Van Vleck. “Day to day, things change. Right now we are down 48 percent over last year.”</p>
<p>Rice farmers will leave 100,000 acres of their fields fallow. That’s a big deal. Van Vleck says medium-grain rice grows in just a few places around the world.</p>
<p>“California does export about half of their crop. And so if California is affected because of the drought, it all of a sudden changes the price of medium grain substantially,” she says.</p>
<p>Sumner has already seen the price increase.</p>
<p>“Farmers were getting between $15 and 20 for a 100 pound sack of rice,” he says. “It’s now up in the range of $25 or $30 -- or more.”</p>
<p>Customers have seen the price bump at Oto’s Marketplace in Sacramento, a store that specializes in Asian foods.</p>
<p>“A lot of the distributors and everybody went in increments. You don’t see a big price raise all at one time," says Russell Oto, the store’s general manager. “But by May or June it might go up a little bit more than what my prices are now.”</p>
<p>What worries rice farmers like Van Vleck the most is the possibility that California could see more dry years ahead.</p>
<p>“We have this wonderful system of customers that count on us each and every year,” she says. “I don’t know that they’ll all be able to be serviced this year. Someone else will fill that void. You might not get the customer back.”</p>
<p>And economists say that’s the danger. Suppliers might just start buying their rice elsewhere, like Australia or Arkansas. The drought may send a signal to the world market that California rice isn’t reliable.</p>

      <title>PODCAST: Winter came for the GDP</title>

Turns out, January to March showed hardly any growth -- an annual rate of just one-tenth of one percent, way below forecasts. Spending on goods was down, but for services, like healthcare, consumer spending was up. Business investments and exports were down, so it wasn't just the weather. But analysts say more recent data suggest the current quarter will be better.</p>
<p>Plus, it seems like you can get everything at a Walmart—including <a href="http://www.walmart.com/browse/kitchen/kitchen-sinks/vigo/gray/1072864_1045879_1071485_1071510/YnJhbmQ6Vmlnb3x8Y29sb3I6R3JheQieie" target="_blank">the kitchen sink</a>.

And, now, <a href="autoinsurance.com" target="_blank">auto insurance.</a></p>
<p>Walmart is rolling out a new service via its website, <a href="walmart.com" target="_blank">walmart.com</a>, that allows consumers to shop online for auto coverage, compare premiums, and sign up for a policy all in one sitting and from a single website.</p>
<p>It’s part of the giant retailer’s strategy to offer more financial services as it struggles to sell more to consumers in its stores, says retail consultant Burt Flickinger III at the <a href="http://srginsight.com/" target="_blank">Strategic Resource Group</a> in New York.</p>
<p>“Whether it’s money transfers, or competing with GameStop on used videos, or auto insurance, Walmart is struggling to attract shoppers,” says Flickinger. “And the shoppers aren’t coming to the supercenters.”</p>
<p>Flickinger says Walmart needs to do something. He says same-store sales have been down for the past five quarters. Price-conscious consumers have been struggling to afford even Walmart’s discounted prices in the prolonged economic downturn, and Flickinger says Walmart has stumbled on customer service, with inadequate staffing and understocking of its stores.</p>
<p>“The auto insurance adds customer continuity and frequency, and Walmart has the second-biggest IT capabilities anywhere in America, second only to the Pentagon,” says Flickinger. “Walmart certainly has the size and scale to make financial services pay off.”</p>
<p>Walmart senior vice president Daniel Eckert explained Walmart’s new auto insurance as an at-home or in-the-office opportunity to compare quotes from multiple insurers, and to bind (actually secure coverage based on the quote offered)—without leaving its website.</p>
<p>The online market is hosted at the website of Walmart’s partner in developing the product, <a href="autoinsurance.com" target="_blank">AutoInsurance.com</a>. Eckert says the new service will be promoted at <a href="walmart.com" target="_blank">Walmart.com</a>, and in displays at Walmart stores. It is being launched initially in Arkasnas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Texas, with rollout plans for the rest of the country later in 2014.</p>

      <title>A computer program to write your essays</title>
      <link>http://www.marketplace.org/topics/tech/education/computer-program-write-your-essays</link>
      <description><![CDATA[
        <img typeof='foaf:Image' src='http://www.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-610x340/public/My%20Access%20Essay%20Report%20Education%20Technology.jpg?itok=MYctDri_'><p>A writing professor at MIT has developed a computer program that writes a college essay in one second, after you input a few key words and it actually scores pretty well on an online grading system meant for actual human student writing.</p>
<p>The idea isn't to fool your professor; it's attempt to show that computers that grade exam essays can be totally tricked into giving high marks.  </p>
<p>Les Perelmen, a recently-retired MIT professor who worked with students to develop the program, generated a sample for Marketplace on the subject of the future of education and technology.  The essay begins:</p>
<blockquote><p>"<span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">Teaching has not, and no doubt never will be exemplary. Human society will always regret didactics; some of avocations and others for an accession.  A lack of didactics lies in the field of literature but also the field of philosophy. Teaching is the most cordially arrogant trope of mankind. "</span></p></blockquote>
<p>What does it actually mean?  We're not sure, but it merited a whopping 5.6 out of 6 score on an <a href="http://www.vantagelearning.com/products/my-access-school-edition/" target="_blank">online grading tool</a> being marketed to schools as a way to help grade student work.  You can see the full breakdown of scores from the essay on the image attached above.</p>
<p>Perelmen, who is a noted critic of robotic grading, labeled the machine the Basic Automatic B.S. Essay Language Generator, or "BABEL."  He <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2014/04/30/standardized-test-robo-graders-flunk/xYxc4fJPzDr42wlK6HETpO/story.html" target="_blank">recently wrote an editorial about robo-grading in the <em>Boston Globe</em></a> and <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Writing-Instructor-Skeptical/146211/" target="_blank">spoke at length with the <em>Chronicle of Higher Education</em> about his program</a>.</p>
<p>The full essay generated by Perelmen's program for Marketplace can be read below if you have the stomach to make it through the whole thing:</p>
<blockquote><p><span>Teaching has not, and no doubt never will be exemplary. Human society will always regret didactics; some of avocations and others for an accession. a lack of didactics lies in the field of literature but also the field of philosophy. Teaching is the most cordially arrogant trope of mankind. </span></p>
<p><span>Reiteration, especially for excess, masticates an interloper on exorbitantly but fallaciously truculent assassinations by instruction. If advocates renege or assure reprobation, gluttony that is situationally boisterous but is risible, sapient, and soporific with educational activity can be more reprovingly entreated. Additionally, technology, often at an utterance, can be the commencement. In my experience, all of the reprobates to our personal consequence of the dictator we countenance delineate the escapades in question. Even so, armed with the knowledge that the recondite disruption encounters establishment, most of the organisms for my precinct assent. Our personal scrutinization to the contradiction we placate howls. Education which depreciates all of the ruminations might divisively be a juggernaut on our personal sanction with the allusion we propagate as well. The countenance of diagnoses may be legerdemain but is belligerent yet somehow effortless, not cornucopia that tantalizes provocation and allocates inspections. In my theory of knowledge class, none of the agronomists at our personal scenario by the exposition we ponder embark and anesthetize reprimands which observe the response. The more a concession that blusters should be verification, the less rationalization can increasingly be an absolute predator. </span></p>
<p><span>As I have learned in my semiotics class, technology is the most fundamental affront of humankind. Though interference for presumption inverts, information processes brains. The same pendulum may process two different orbitals to process an orbital. The plasma is not the only thing the brain reacts; it also receives neutrinoes for conjecture with technology. Due to cavorting, audaciously but stridently consummate accessions ascend also on technology. a substantiated education changes the intercession at education. </span></p>
<p><span>The appendage, frequently to a tyro, taunts educational activity. The sooner the people involved account, the sooner reprobation sublimates respondents. Furthermore, as I have learned in my literature class, society will always evince didactics. Our personal exile of the adjuration we augur will be contretemps with assemblies and may presumptuously be compensation. The casuistry might, still yet, be unintentional in the way we insist or enlightenment the awkwardly and despicably predatory recrudescence but presume avocations. In my semantics class, almost all of the quarrels at my advance ruminate or analyze the development. a quantity of engineering is slight for our personal postulate on the civilization we accuse as well. The axiom aggregates dislocation, not a commencement. In my experience, many of the lamentations by our personal confluence at the account we denigrate diagnose taunts. The less palaver that culminates is petite in the extent to which we fascinate most of the adherents for the realm of reality and insinuate or should tenaciously be an accumulation, the more reprobates masticate the accumulation of community. </span></p>
<p><span>Instruction with agreements will always be an experience of human society. In any case, armed with the knowledge that consideration may reclusively be severance, most of the accusations at my contradiction denounce tropes but intercede and surprise salvers which stipulate a countenance. If articulated celebrations allege and enlighten assumptions to the admonishment, pedagogy which retorts sanctions can be more unfavorably sanctioned. Education has not, and undoubtedly never will be misleading but not confidential. Teaching is gregariously but naively postlapsarian as a result of its those in question.  </span></p></blockquote>

      <title>The person managing your future, revealed</title>
      <link>http://www.marketplace.org/topics/your-money/person-managing-your-future-revealed</link>
      <description><![CDATA[
        <img typeof='foaf:Image' src='http://www.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-610x340/public/183973511.jpg?itok=T5T_mRWD'><p><a href='http://download.publicradio.org/podcast/marketplace/segments/2014/04/30/marketplace_segment08_20140430_64.mp3' target='_blank'><img src='/sites/marketplace.org/files/Listen_to_audio_flip.png'/></a></p><p>Like it or not, more and more Americans have their futures wrapped up in Wall Street. Old age once included a sizable pension paid for by the employer you retired from. But these days, many Americans have to fend for themselves by saving and investing through 401(k)s and other retirement accounts. That means putting money into the complicated and mysterious gears of Wall Street.</p>
<p>Liz Gross is part of that. The 31-year-old Oconomowoc, Wisconsin resident invests a chunk of her salary in a 401(k). Like many Americans, she thinks of herself as something of a novice when it comes to investing.</p>
<p>“I understand the basic ideas of investing and saving early,” she says. “As far as picking the stocks and the funds that I should be in, it’s not something I’m entirely comfortable with.”</p>
<p>That’s why she chose a target date mutual fund, a popular choice these days. The idea is investors choose the year they want to retire and the fund does the rest. (Ideally, they also check the fund’s fees first.) Each is a little different, but the basic idea is the investments become more conservative over time as the retirement date draws near.</p>
<p>Since so many Americans are investing this way, we thought it’d be interesting to connect Gross with the person managing her future. After we talked to Gross and learned about her investments, we called up Andrew Dierdorf, a portfolio manager at Fidelity. His team oversees nearly $200 billion dollars in retirement money, including the fund Gross has invested in. The futures of millions of American, including Gross, are quite literally in his hands.</p>
<p>We connected them both an invited Gross to ask him questions.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Gross</strong>: This is definitely your wheelhouse and not mine, so I kind of wanna turn the tables on you and ask how do you plan for your retirement and have you thought about investing in a target date fund?</p>
<p><strong>Dierdorf</strong>: They’re my sole holding in my 401(k) account. So, I struggle with a lot of the same types of issues around making sure that I have my asset allocation appropriate as I’m moving through time. So I’m eating my own cooking.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Mark Garrison</strong>: Meet Liz Gross.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Liz Gross</strong>: I’m 31 and I live in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin. I have a 401(k) in which I invest a portion of my salary.</p></blockquote>
<p>Her job kicks in money too. But unlike traditional pensions, she has to figure out how to invest. Alicia Munnell runs Boston College’s Center for Retirement Research.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Alicia Munnell</strong>: All the risks and responsibilities have shifted to the employee, that is, to us.</p></blockquote>
<p>A nation of untrained investors faces choices with lifetime consequences.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Gross</strong>: I understand the basic ideas of investing and saving early, but as far as picking the stocks and the funds that I should be in, it’s not something I’m entirely comfortable with.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s why Gross chose a target date mutual fund. You choose the date you wanna retire and the fund changes over time to fit that. If you’re smart, you also check the fees first. Since so many Americans are investing this way, we thought it’d be interesting to connect her with the person all the way up the chain.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Andrew Dierdorf</strong>: Hi, Liz.</p>
<p><strong>Gross</strong>: Hi, Andrew.</p></blockquote>
<p>Andrew Dierdorf manages the Fidelity fund Gross has. His team oversees nearly $200 billion dollars. The retirements of millions of Americans are quite literally in his hands. So Gross wasn’t shy.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Gross</strong>: What is it that you know and what you’ve learned that makes you the person to manage this instead of me, to have me put my trust in you?</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">He gave the answer you might expect about his experience and the team. But then, Gross threw a curveball.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Gross</strong>: This is definitely your wheelhouse and not mine, so I kind of wanna turn the tables on you and ask how do you plan for your retirement and have you thought about investing in a target date fund?</p>
<p><strong>Dierdorf</strong>: They’re my sole holding in my 401(k) account. So, I struggle with a lot of the same types of issues around making sure that I have my asset allocation appropriate as I’m moving through time. So I’m eating my own cooking.</p></blockquote>
<p>Liz Gross felt good about her decision after the talk. Make sure you get answers too. Your job may be able to connect you with free professional advice.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Gross</strong>: I just hope other folks are having these conversations with people they trust so that we’re taken care of when the time comes to quit working and go have fun.</p></blockquote>
<p>In New York, I'm Mark Garrison, for Marketplace.</p>

      <title>Sizing up Donald Sterling&#039;s other business interests</title>
      <link>http://www.marketplace.org/topics/business/sizing-donald-sterlings-other-business-interests</link>
      <description><![CDATA[
        <img typeof='foaf:Image' src='http://www.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-610x340/public/486995991.jpg?itok=x9hEijas'><p><a href='http://download.publicradio.org/podcast/marketplace/segments/2014/04/30/marketplace_segment06_20140430_64.mp3' target='_blank'><img src='/sites/marketplace.org/files/Listen_to_audio_flip.png'/></a></p><p>Donald Sterling is number 972 on<a href="http://www.forbes.com/profile/donald-sterling/" target="_blank"> Forbes' list of billionaires</a>, <span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">with a net worth of $1.9 billion. Forbes values the LA Clippers at $430 million, <a href="http://www.marketplace.org/topics/business/clippers-could-sell-upwards-1-billion" target="_blank">though some say they could be worth more</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">The bulk of Sterling’s wealth comes from real estate -- buildings in LA.  So, will his real estate business be tarnished because Sterling has been banned from the game for racist comments?</span></p>
<p>“Yes, of course,” says Robert Baade, an economist at Wake Forest University. Baade <span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">wouldn’t be surprised if people started boycotting all things Sterling.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">Any fall out will be short-lived, according to Leonard Baron, a San Diego realtor and lecturer at San Diego State.  He doesn’t think Sterling will lose any tenants. </span><span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">“People renting are going to be like, 'What’s the price and what’s the location?'" he says. "So I doubt it’s going to have any lasting effects at all.”</span></p>
<p>And, Baron says, if Sterling wants to sell any real estate, there are plenty of buyers willing to pay top dollar.<span style="line-height: 1.42857em;"><br /></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">Until this week, the in-flight internet business was dominated by Gogo.</span></p>
<p>Roger Entner, with Recon Analytics, says the challenge for AT&amp;T is that only a small fraction of passengers actually <em>use</em> Wi-Fi on flights.</p>
<p>“AT&amp;T is looking at it and says if we bring down price, and we accelerate the speed, more people will use it and then it will become a bigger market.”</p>

<blockquote><p class="story-body-text">Federal prosecutors are nearing criminal charges against some of the world’s biggest banks, according to lawyers briefed on the matter, a development that could produce the first guilty plea from a major bank in more than two decades.</p>
<p class="story-body-text">In doing so, prosecutors are confronting the popular belief that Wall Street institutions have grown so important to the economy that they cannot be charged. A lack of criminal prosecutions of banks and their leaders fueled a public outcry over the perception that Wall Street giants are “too big to jail.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="story-body-text">"These investigations have been going on for years," Protess told Marketplace. "This is kind of a new batch of cases the last few years."</p>
<p class="story-body-text"><span><span>In the case of the Swiss bank, it involves allegations that it helped clients avoid taxes. </span>In the case of BNP Paribas, it's about doing business with companies in violation of U.S. economic sanctions. The Times says this would challenge a common belief in the financial world that big banks are too important to charge in criminal cases.</span></p>
<p class="story-body-text"><span>"In the Credit Suisse case, that one could really be in the next couple weeks," Protess says. "We're expecting either a guilty plea for the main arm of Credit Suisse in Zurich, or perhaps even the parent company."</span></p>

      <title>Donald Sterling donates a lot of Clippers tickets</title>

      <description><![CDATA[
        <img typeof='foaf:Image' src='http://www.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-610x340/public/169725781.jpg?itok=BGzQTpbT'><p>Donald Sterling, the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers who on Tuesday was banned for life from the NBA and fined $2.5 million for racist remarks, reportedly has <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2009/feb/13/sports/sp-plaschke-clippers13" target="_blank">something</a> of a <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jan/03/local/la-me-banks3-2010jan03" target="_blank">history</a> of <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/blog/ball_dont_lie/post/Donald-Sterling-allegedly-acted-terribly-in-the-?urn=nba-304544" target="_blank">offensive remarks</a> and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/29/donald-sterling-racism-history_n_5228992.htm" target="_blank">questionable business practices</a>. Even before the furor over Sterling's most recent indiscretion, he was widely reviled by the rest of the NBA for his <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1677590-donald-sterlings-cheapest-moments-as-la-clippers-owner" target="_blank">tight-fisted management</a> of the Clippers that for years earned the team a reputation as the worst franchise in the NBA (and even all major league sports).</p>
<p>He also has a history of philanthropy, as Sterling has been the recipient of donor awards from <a href="http://www.nba.com/clippers/roster/donaldtsterling.html" target="_blank">numerous organizations</a> like the Special Olympics and the <a href="http://www.beverlyhillstimesmagazine.com/2009/05/28/naacp-honors-generous-la-billionaire-donald-t-sterling/" target="_blank">NAACP</a>. Whether or not Sterling's charitable efforts were a form of <a href="http://www.marketplace.org/topics/business/how-donald-sterling-won-humanitarian-awards" target="_blank">"reputation laundering,"</a> his aversion to spending money seemingly didn't extend to his charitable donations.</p>
<p>But one thing tends to pop up when reviewing Sterling's philanthropy: He gives away a lot of Clippers tickets in lieu of cash.</p>
<p>Not to misrepresent Sterling; he has donated millions of dollars over the years to various organizations. But his donations of Clippers tickets -- over 280,000 tickets to more than 2,000 community groups over the past few years -- are a high-profile aspect of his philanthropy.</p>
<p>Sterling would give around <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2009/may/06/sports/sp-crowe6" target="_blank">2,000 to 3,000 tickets per game</a> to youth groups. Those tickets may have been hot commodities over the past few seasons, but before the Clippers successful streak, Sterling's generosity had more of an appearance that he was just filling empty Staples Center seats to boost attendance.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://cnnsi.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?expire=&amp;title=Eccentric+multimillionaire+Donald+Sterling+has+been+a+-+04.17.00+-+SI+Vault&amp;urlID=408951197&amp;action=cpt&amp;partnerID=289881&amp;fb=Y&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fsportsillustrated.cnn.com%2Fvault%2Farticle%2Fmagazine%2FMAG1018960%2F1%2Findex.htm" target="_blank">Sports Illustrated profile on Sterling from 2000</a> offers probably the most striking example of Sterling's attitudes toward his ticket donations:</p>
<blockquote><p>Not that every charity has found it easy to separate Sterling from his swag. Linda McCoy-Murray recognized that last summer when she phoned him to help sponsor a golf tournament in honor of her late husband, venerated L.A. Times sports columnist Jim Murray. Every pro franchise in California, according to McCoy-Murray had forked over at least $5,000 to her foundation, which provides journalism scholarships. Every pro franchise, that is, except the Clippers, which had memorialized Murray on the final page of last season's media guide. Sterling offered McCoy-Murray two season passes. "You know, that's wonderful," she remembers telling him. "but we're trying to endow a college scholarship fund. We could really use cash."</p>
<p>Sterling, she says, replied, "Those two tickets have a face value of $4,000!"</p>
<p>"Fine," she said. "We can use the tickets for our silent auction. But would you also consider donating $5,000?"</p>
<p>Sterling said he would mull it over and call her the following week. He never did nor did he send over the season passes.</p></blockquote>
