# Inline Asset Placeholder

This is our own plugin that allows AssetHost assets to be dragged and dropped into the CKEditor with a special placeholder representing a "shortcode".  The shortcode is simply an image tag containing an asset id which, on rendering, is used to grab the image and its caption from the AssetHost API.
